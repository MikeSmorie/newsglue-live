Transcript
0:01
The market's trading like yesterday's FOMC was an  absolute nothing-burger, and the truth is that at  
0:07
face value, it was an absolute nothing-burger.  But if you read between the lines, I'm going   to show you why I think the FOMC was actually  very hawkish yesterday, a very negative FOMC,  
0:15
and I think the market will start pricing that  in. Also, I want to talk about this specific   chart today, the oil chart, because as you can  see, the oil price is going up, and that leads  
0:25
to speculation that today, whilst the US markets  are closed, the US may actually join the war and  
0:31
actually invade Iran. We're going to talk about  the possibilities of that and why actually oil is   moving up. Then I want to talk to you about why  I think that this market could actually have a  
0:42
correction. I'm not going to say crash, not going  to be a massive crash, but we could have a major   pullback in the next 14 days. And once we're done  with that, I want to talk to you about the GENIUS  
0:50
Act that was actually approved yesterday by the  Senate. And I want to talk to you about all the   different implications because I think what you're  not really seeing is that this Senate act can  
0:58
bring trillions of dollars into crypto. And when  I say it, I'm going to say it again, trillions,  
1:03
with a 'T', of dollars into crypto. So I've got  a massive show today. I know it's Juneteenth Day  
1:11
in the US, so a lot of our US friends are still  asleep, but we're going to bring you a massive   show filled with alpha and love and wisdom and  everything that comes with it. Let's go, guys.
1:32
Okay, it's Juneteenth. I got a little bit  of a flu, but my amazing chief of staff  
1:38
has made me this tea. I mean, look at this  tea, guys. It's got ginger, it's got mint,  
1:44
it's got lemon, it's got tea, and I added a bit  of honey just to make it amazing. So that should   keep my voice going while I bring you amazing  crypto love. I should also keep water off my  
1:53
laptop while I bring you amazing crypto love and  crypto wisdom today. And I know it's Juneteenth,  
1:58
and usually on holidays in the US, the  news cycle is very slow, but this show  
2:04
is not going to be slow today because there's  a lot happening today that we need to discuss.   So I'm going to bring you bombs of alpha. You  just need to do one thing. All I'm asking you  
2:17
is just obliterate the like button. I'm going to  take sips of tea. Every time I take a sip of tea,  
2:23
I'm going to bring you more alpha. That's  how basically it works. So let's start   with the first... Oh, my chief of staff  is the best person in the whole world.
2:31
Anyway, let's get into it. So we had the  FOMC meeting last night. Actually, before  
2:36
we get into the FOMC meeting last night, I know  that it seems like the markets are very quiet,  
2:42
and actually, the markets are very quiet.  There was actually a trader on Polymarket   where this trader made a quarter of a million  dollars by betting that nothing will happen.  
2:52
He bet that Ethereum wouldn't reach $4,000 in  June, Putin wouldn't meet with Zelenskyy out  
2:58
of Ukraine. He pretty much took a bet that  nothing would change, nothing would happen,   and that bet basically paid out. It paid him  out $250,000. So if you feel like the markets  
3:08
are slow and the markets are boring, you  actually may not be that far from the truth. But on that note, let's talk about the FOMC. So  we had the FOMC last night, and at face value,  
3:18
it really felt like nothing happened. The price  now is the same price as it was yesterday before  
3:23
the FOMC. Yes, we went slightly down to 103,500,  but then we went back up. And the reason why that  
3:30
happened was because effectively, what  traders were saying is, look, interest   rates were unchanged. The Fed's dot plot basically  showed that there were going to be two rate cuts,  
3:39
which is exactly what the dot plot said the last  time they had a dot plot, so nothing changed   when it comes to that. And then there were some  movements when it came to GDP and stuff like that.  
3:50
So at face value, yesterday's FOMC kind of felt  like it was a nothing-burger, but I read between  
3:57
the lines. And when you look between the lines,  to me, it kind of feels like there's a hawkish   undertone that no one spoke about yesterday. I  want to talk to you about that hawkish undertone.
4:08
So there are two things that the market doesn't  like. The first thing that the market doesn't like  
4:13
is uncertainty. When you have uncertainty, markets  don't like that and usually markets trade down.  
4:20
Now, what's the peak of the uncertainty? The peak  of the uncertainty is when the Fed is uncertain.  
4:26
When the Fed is uncertain, then you know that  even the Feds don't have conviction in their  
4:32
marketplace. And when the Fed has uncertainty,  then let me tell you, I've got uncertainty. If  
4:38
you look at the dot plot, and for those of  you who don't know what the dot plot is,   every quarter at the FOMC meeting, they  take the 19 people that work at the Fed,  
4:48
the 19 governors, and they ask them, "Where do you  think interest rates will be at the end of 2025,  
4:55
at the end of 2026, and at the end of 2027, and  in the long run?" Okay. Last time we had this,  
5:02
the consensus vote was that there were going  to be two rate cuts. So we are here now, and  
5:08
the consensus vote was that there were going to be  two rate cuts, and we were going to be at between  
5:14
3.75% and 4% by the end of 2025, which equates  to two rate cuts. And we're still there. In fact,  
5:21
if you count the number of dots, eight people said  that there's going to be two rate cuts this year,  
5:32
seven people said there are going to be no  rate cuts this year, two said there were going   to be three rate cuts this year, and two said  there was going to be one rate cut this year.
5:40
So what do you read in between the lines? What  you're reading in between the lines is that   there's no consensus amongst the Fed governors.  Half of them are saying, or seven are saying that  
5:52
there's going to be no rate cuts, two are saying  there's going to be one rate cut, eight are saying  
5:57
that there's going to be two rate cuts. And the  market's taking that as consensus amongst the   Fed that there's going to be two rate cuts this  year. The first issue that I'm having around the  
6:06
uncertainty is that there is no consensus amongst  the Fed. Pretty much half of them believe one  
6:13
thing, and the other one believes there's going  to be two rate cuts. That to me is a little bit  
6:19
of a problem because what I want in the Fed is I  want them to be united in their decisions. I want   them to understand the data and to say that based  on the data, they've got a single-minded strategy.  
6:29
That's not the case here. Half say there's  going to be two rate cuts, half say there's   going to be no rate cuts, and then you've got the  stragglers which are on the other side. So that's  
6:36
the first bit of uncertainty that I'm seeing.  It means that the Fed governors themselves don't  
6:43
know whether they should be reducing rates or not  reducing rates. Now remember, there are four more  
6:48
Fed meetings this year. There is a meeting in  July, September, October, and December, and  
7:00
the July meeting says there's a 91% chance that  there's going to be no rate cuts. So that's the   first thing that I didn't like about yesterday's  FOMC. There is uncertainty. Markets don't like  
7:10
uncertainty. What markets like even less than  uncertainty is when the Fed has uncertainty.  
7:16
Markets really don't like that, and that for  me is something that never came out yesterday.
7:23
The second thing that happened yesterday, not only  did they have to do a dot plot, but they also had  
7:29
to tell us what they think the GDP is going to be  at the end of 2025, 2026, and 2027, and what the  
7:38
unemployment is going to be at 2025, 2026, and  2027. And if you add up all that the Fed members  
7:48
said, they all revised their growth forecasts  lower from 1.7% to 1.4%, and they revised their  
7:58
unemployment higher from 4.4% to 4.5%. What  does that mean? It means you're going to have  
8:06
a slower economy with more unemployment. In other  words, stagflation. Now, what is stagflation? I  
8:15
looked it up on ChatGPT to make it simple. It says  stagflation is an economic condition characterized  
8:22
by three simultaneous problems: stagnant economic  growth, high inflation, and high unemployment.  
8:29
Now, why is it unusual? Because normally when  inflation rises, it means that the markets are  
8:34
heated, and when the markets are heated, there  is more employment, and the other way around.  
8:42
But when you get stagflation, prices keep rising,  you keep getting inflation, but at the same time,  
8:51
the economy is slowing and jobs are lost.  So tariffs, for example, could cause massive   stagflation. And so the Fed governors basically  said their base case is actually stagflation.
9:05
Now, what's the problem with stagflation? The  problem with stagflation is that the Fed doesn't  
9:11
actually have a medicine for stagflation. We know  that if inflation is high, the Fed can increase  
9:19
interest rates, and that will bring inflation  down. We know that if unemployment is high,   the Fed can reduce interest rates, stimulate the  economy, and that will get employment up again.  
9:31
The problem is that when you have high  unemployment and high inflation, the Fed is caught  
9:37
in a conundrum because there's absolutely nothing  you can do. So what do we say about this? Well,  
9:43
it's like going to a doctor and the doctor says  to you, "Look, you're sick and I'm going to treat  
9:48
you. I'm going to give you medicine, and I know  that the medicine that I'm going to give you is  
9:54
going to put you in a position where later on,  I won't actually have tools to medicate you."   That's pretty much what's happening with the  economy. The Fed is basically acting right now  
10:05
in such a way that they know that it's going  to cause stagflation, and they know that when   you get to stagflation, there's really not  much that they can do. They don't actually  
10:13
have tools to deal with stagflation, and that's  what worries me about last night's FOMC. Yes,  
10:18
it seemed like a nothing-burger, but again,  if you read between the lines, number one,   the Fed governors themselves aren't actually  united. And number two, the one place where  
10:28
they are united is that the base case now  is actually stagflation. And the reality  
10:35
is that if they get to stagflation, there's  nothing they can do. Because as ChatGPT says,  
10:43
it puts the central banks in a tough spot.  Raising interest rates fights inflation but   can worsen unemployment. Lowering rates might  boost growth but worsen inflation. Oh wow,  
10:53
and that's the base case what the Fed  governors are basically talking about. Now, someone says, "No offense, but this  guy doesn't know what he's talking about  
11:05
in this regard." Okay, Free Hammer, maybe  you can come here and you can do the show,   because I think I have a pretty good  understanding of exactly what's going on,  
11:13
and I think that a lot of people actually landed  up missing that. And to be honest, I do know that  
11:19
Trump was pressuring Powell yesterday to reduce  rates. He called him "Too Late Powell." He said   he wanted to nominate himself as the Fed chairman.  And the truth is that I actually believe that the  
11:31
Fed... I know it's not the best opinion in the  whole world, it's not the most popular opinion,   but I actually believe that the Fed cannot cut  rates, or they have no reason to cut rates.  
11:41
Inflation isn't at 2%, although it is coming  down, but they got tariffs on the horizon,   and they don't know what the implications of those  tariffs are going to be, number one. Then they've  
11:52
also got unemployment. So the issue is that right  now, the Fed has no reason to move. Nothing is  
12:01
broken. They don't need to reduce rates. And so I  know Trump wants rates to come down because he's   got debt to refinance, but Powell's job isn't to  refinance debt. Powell's job is to keep inflation  
12:12
and unemployment at good levels, and actually,  Powell's doing an amazing job at that. And I  
12:20
put myself in Powell's shoes yesterday. I said,  "What would I have done? Would I have reduced   interest rates?" Absolutely not. I'm not reducing  interest rates. Why? Because I don't know what the  
12:28
impact of tariffs is going to be. And so that  is pretty much where the Fed is at the moment.
12:35
Let's move on to the next topic which I want to  talk about today, and that to me is a little bit   more worrying because it's a little bit more  right here, right now. And that is this chart  
12:44
over here. So this is the oil chart, and you know  that I drew a line on that oil chart over here,  
12:57
and that line I called the "war line." Now,  what is the war line? It's the downward-sloping,  
13:04
it's a downward-trending oil price since  2022. So the height of 2022 was $131,  
13:11
and then since then, oil has been on a  downward trend, and now oil is trading at   $76. $76 is higher than when Israel invaded Iran,  and since then, the price of oil actually came  
13:23
down to like $72-$73. Now we've got the oil price  going very close to the trend line over here. Now,  
13:32
my theory is that everything that we hear in  the media is noise until we break... the only  
13:40
source of truth, the only signal of truth, is  this downward-sloping trend line. And if we  
13:47
break this trend line, it means that there's  a major escalation in the Middle East. Now,   what the market's telling you is that we're very  close to touching or breaking that trend line.
13:56
Now, what can that mean? It could mean that  the US is actually going to step in after  
14:03
everything that's happening. By the way, these  are some attacks that happened in Israel. That's   the diamond building that was blown up, the  Diamond Exchange. That is a medical center,  
14:11
it's called Soroka Medical Center, that was blown  up. You had Trump talking yesterday, and he says,   "Look, we're way beyond a ceasefire with Iran."  He said, "I was going back home to make a  </div>

The headlines are ablaze with the news: "WARNING: Markets Could Dump In 14 Days!" This stark alert from Crypto Banter has sent ripples of anxiety through investors and market watchers alike. With over a million subscribers tuning in for insights, this warning hints at potential waves of volatility in both crypto and stock markets. But what does this mean for you, and how can you navigate through this looming uncertainty?

## Reading Between the Lines of Market Warnings

In a detailed analysis, Ran, the host of Crypto Banter, pinpoints that while the markets seem quiet on the surface, there are undercurrents that experts believe could trigger a significant market pullback within the next 14 days. Factors like the hawkish implications of the recent FOMC meeting, growing tensions in international geopolitics, and the precarious position of stablecoins are all creating a perfect storm.

### The FOMC Meeting Unveiled: Is Stagflation on the Horizon?

Ran's analysis delves deep into the Federal Open Market Committee's decisions, which at first glance seemed like a "nothing-burger". However, beneath this facade lies substantial grounds for concern. The Fed's lack of consensus on future rate cuts, coupled with a prediction for looming stagflation, paints a concerning picture of economic stagnation mixed with inflation and unemployment.

- **Uncertainty and Market Behavior**: Markets thrive on certainty, and the Fed's indecision is causing ripples of anxiety.
- **Stagflation Fears**: With revised predictions for economic growth dropping to 1.4% and unemployment expected to climb, stagflation appears a growing threat.
- **Global Tensions**: Escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly involving the US and Iran, further exacerbate market jitters.
