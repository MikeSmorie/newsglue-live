Execute only this prompt and don‚Äôt try to interpret or anticipate what comes next.

Purpose:
Create Module 4 by duplicating the proven structure of Module 5 (Google Keyword Search) with API integration using the existing News Aggregator key already stored in secrets. This module will support campaign-aligned news discovery via alternate channels.

Scope:

‚úÖ CLONE: Full Module 5 architecture ‚Äî both frontend and backend ‚Äî renamed and scoped to Module 4 (News Aggregator)

‚úÖ BACKEND ROUTES (use /api/news-aggregator/...):

‚Ä¢ GET /keywords/:campaignId
‚Ä¢ POST /keywords/:campaignId
‚Ä¢ DELETE /keywords/:keywordId

‚Ä¢ POST /search/:campaignId
‚Ä¢ POST /search-keyword/:campaignId/:keywordId
‚Ä¢ GET /articles/:campaignId

‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION:

‚Ä¢ Reuse transfer-to-Module-6 handler from Module 5
‚Ä¢ Campaign context must be passed and enforced
‚Ä¢ Disable caching on all fetches

‚úÖ VISUAL:

‚Ä¢ Include tooltips for all icons
‚Ä¢ Ensure all UI affordances match Module 5
‚Ä¢ Tooltip legend:
  - üìé Edit keyword
  - üîç Search keyword
  - üóëÔ∏è Delete keyword
  - ü°Ü Send to Module 6
