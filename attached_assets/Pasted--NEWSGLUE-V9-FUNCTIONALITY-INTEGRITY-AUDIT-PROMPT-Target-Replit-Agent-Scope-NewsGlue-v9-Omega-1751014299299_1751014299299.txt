 
✅ NEWSGLUE-V9 FUNCTIONALITY INTEGRITY AUDIT PROMPT

Target: Replit Agent
Scope: NewsGlue-v9 (Omega-9 foundation)
Goal: Validate and repair campaign-siloed workflows, UI logic, DB writes, AI responses, and routing integrity.
 
🔐 GENERAL RULES
•	🚫 No architecture changes or rewrites
•	🔍 Only validate and repair current functionality
•	🔒 Ensure campaign isolation — no data leaks between campaigns
 
🔍 PHASE 1 — UI & Navigation Audit (Campaign Mode)
1.	Confirm campaign selector logic:
o	Campaign cards are clickable and route into correct silo
o	Sidebar only appears once a campaign is selected
o	Campaign switch clears previous state and refreshes modules cleanly
2.	Validate UI across 10 modules (/module/1 to /module/10):
o	Sidebar and header routing works bidirectionally
o	Buttons and tabs are functional, not duplicated or misplaced
o	? tooltips render and are campaign-contextual
 
🔍 PHASE 2 — Input System + Voice Capture Audit
1.	Test all field types in each module:
o	Text inputs, dropdowns, sliders, toggles, file/image uploads
o	Voice-to-text icons appear in longform fields and capture input
2.	Submit dummy data in each module
3.	Confirm campaign-bound database save:
o	Inputs persist on refresh
o	Data remains within selected campaign scope only
o	No cross-campaign bleed
 
🔍 PHASE 3 — AI & Prompt Processing Logic
1.	Run NewsJack AI (Module 2) on sample input:
o	Confirm AI call includes intake + tone + archetype context
o	Platform-specific content returned (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
o	Output written to correct database fields
2.	Run AI logic in any other AI-enabled modules (e.g., Planning, Cortex)
3.	Validate:
o	Re-runs and alternates trigger new AI generations
o	Regenerate and Edit buttons behave as expected
 
🔍 PHASE 4 — Backend & Database Schema Audit
1.	Confirm all tables exist and match expected schema:
o	e.g., campaigns, newsjacks, social_outputs, module_inputs
o	All contain IDs, timestamps, and campaign_id for binding
2.	Submit inputs and verify backend receives correct payloads
3.	Validate relational writes:
o	One-to-many mappings (campaign → newsjacks)
o	Admin-level visibility for multi-user or enterprise users
 
🔍 PHASE 5 — Admin & Supergod Control Check
1.	Log in as admin (or impersonate)
2.	Confirm ability to:
o	View/edit all campaigns
o	Trigger campaign resets or deletions
o	View AI call logs and DB write traces
3.	Confirm campaign-permission separation:
o	No visibility into other users’ campaigns unless admin
 
📤 REPORT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return the following in markdown:
•	❌ Broken/missing UI buttons or unclickable components
•	❌ AI calls failing, unresponsive, or returning null
•	❌ Fields or modules not writing to DB or leaking across campaigns
•	❌ Inactive voice inputs or placeholders with no handlers
•	❌ Routing bugs: incorrect path after click, sidebar exposed prematurely
•	✅ Fixes made (per item, with filename and line number if possible)
 
✅ Final Confirmation Output
✓ NEWSGLUE-V9 audit complete — all UI, routing, campaign isolation, voice input, AI logic, and DB flows verified and repaired.
