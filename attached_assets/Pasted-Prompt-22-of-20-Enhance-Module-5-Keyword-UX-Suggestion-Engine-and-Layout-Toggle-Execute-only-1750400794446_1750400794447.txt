### PROMPT 22 of 20 – Enhance Module 5: Suggest Keywords + UX Toggle for Search vs Results

🎯 Purpose:
Upgrade Module 5 interface and intelligence to improve usability, clarity, and discoverability. Add AI-powered keyword suggestion logic and overhaul layout to separate keyword search and result views cleanly.

📌 New Features to Implement:

1. 🧠 Suggest Keywords (AI Feature)
- Add prominent "Suggest Keywords" button
- Button triggers API call to OpenAI
- Input: Campaign description + product/service (from Module 1)
- Output: 5–15 keywords likely to yield news relevant to campaign
- Keywords are editable and deletable
- Suggested keywords are stored in local state and session DB

2. 🧭 Search vs. Results Toggle
- Create two persistent toggle buttons at the top:
    • [ Search Panel ]
    • [ Search Results ]
- Toggle state determines whether the keyword field or article stack is shown
- Default state on load = “Search Panel”
- Toggle bar must always remain fixed/sticky at top of Module 5 viewport

3. ✅ Maintain:
- Search results sorted by freshness (newest on top)
- Transfer button removes from Module 5 and sends to Module 6
- Bulk deletion, select-all, and “delete selected” controls for keyword list
- Result cards retain relevance score and freshness tag

📁 Files Modified:
- `client/src/modules/5-google-news/index.tsx`
- `components/KeywordSuggestPanel.tsx`
- `components/TogglePanelBar.tsx`
- `server/routes/keyword-ai.ts` (new)
- `server/services/openai-keywords.ts`

🎨 UX:
- Toggle buttons styled as large tabs
- Search results box expands to full width when active
- Keep scroll position remembered between toggles
- Keywords rendered with delete ✖ icon and optional search 🔍 icon
- Suggested keywords visually tagged (e.g. AI icon or “Suggested” badge)

🧠 AI Prompt to Use (OpenAI):
You are an expert keyword strategist for digital campaigns. Given the following campaign description and product/service, suggest 10–15 high-value Google News keywords likely to surface recent, relevant articles that resonate with the campaign’s audience.

📌 Output Formatting:
- Filter duplicates
- Trim to 2–4 words per keyword
- Reject low-information keywords like “business,” “news,” etc.

💾 Database Note:
- Store keywords per campaign
- Suggested keywords are marked with `source: "AI"`
- Enable overwrite vs append control in future version (flag as TODO)
